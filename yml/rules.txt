Here are the server rules, I'll try to keep things simple and chill.

**1. Be respectful**
You must respect all users, regardless of your liking towards them. Drama will not be tolerated here, go elsewhere.

**2. No spamming**
Don't send a lot of small messages right after each other. Do not disrupt chat by spamming.

**3. No pornographic/adult/other NSFW material**
This is a community server and not meant to share this kind of material.

**4. Direct & Indirect Threats**
Threats to other users of death, doxing, abuse, and other malicious threats are absolutely prohibited and disallowed.

**5. Being a shit disturber**
Don't fuck around with the bots to annoy people.
Don't spam pings, spam messages or just be annoying in general.

**MC SERVER RULES**

**1. Common sense**   
You have a head, use it. Don't be a dick towards others.

**2. No vandalism**
 Don't vandalize/break other peoples work. Stealing included. 

**3. No spawn killing**
Pretty self-explanatory

**4. Creepers**
Fill in the creeper craters if you make a huge fucking gaping hole in the ground.

**5. CLIENTS**
Use one, I'll ban you.

All discord server rules apply in and outside the MC server. Please report MC server incidents to #reports  <@&764197768138850314> or <@&764197840683401216>  (or me) will be those who take care of it.
